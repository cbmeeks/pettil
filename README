PETTIL is being developed with the VICE package, which is a Commodore PET
emulator that runs under several different operating systems.  I'm doing 
this on Ubuntu Linux, but Windows and Mac users should be able to use
PETTIL on VICE too.  And of course, actual PETs will run it. 

The project blog is at http://pettil.tumblr.com

Objectives of the project are, in no particular order:
* make a Forth that runs on my Commodore PET 2001
* have fun
* improve my "6502 assembly golf" skills
* find other people who are interested in this project

Future directions
* have a "Forth written in Forth" (metacompilation)
* implement a retro videogame 
* add support for more 6502-based computers and storage devices
* C=64, Upgrade ROM PETs, VIC-20 ports

The documentation in Tiddlywiki format is generated from the source code
tree.  In addition to a Glossary, I will try to describe some of the more
unusual concepts for an 8-bit Forth and attempt to justify why I put them
into PETTIL.  A copy from the most recent build is hosted at 
http://chitselb.com/files/tiddlypettil.html

There is no linker or relocation loader.  pettil.obj is a simple concatenation
of pettil-core.obj + pettil-tdict.obj + pettil.sym

pettil-core is the base language runtime
* arithmetic, boolean and relational operators
* stack and memory manipulation
* virtual memory support
* inner interpreter
* Sweet-16

pettil-tdict (the transient dictionary) contains parts required for development
but not for application runtime.  Anything that touches the symbol table, and
the symbol table itself will disappear, freeing up all but ~6K of RAM for 
application code

* outer interpreter
* defining words
* compiler
* assembler
* editor

To build PETTIL, clone this repository, install xa65, ruby and VICE

$ make                       # this does a build and runs PETTIL

Please email chitselb@gmail.com
with any suggestions for improving the documentation.  I want my mom to be
able to understand this and run PETTIL.
