PETTIL is being developed with the vice package, which is a Commodore PET
emulator that runs under several different operating systems.  I'm doing 
this on Ubuntu Linux, but Windows and Mac users should be able to use
PETTIL too.  Eventually a C=64 port is planned.

Objectives of the project are, in no particular order:
* make a Forth that runs on my Commodore PET 2001
* have fun
* improve my "6502 assembly golf" skills
* find other people who are interested in this project

Future directions
* have a "Forth written in Forth" (metacompilation)
* separate spaces for code and dictionary headers
* implement a retro videogame 
* add support for more 6502-based computers and storage devices

The project blog is at http://pettil.tumblr.com

The documentation in Tiddlywiki format is generated from the source code
tree.  In addition to a Glossary, I will try to describe some of the more
unusual concepts for an 8-bit Forth and attempt to justify why I put them
into PETTIL.  A copy from the most recent build is hosted at 
http://chitselb.com/files/tiddlypettil.html  Please email chitselb@gmail.com
with any suggestions for improving the documentation.  I want my mom to be
able to understand this and run PETTIL.

xap.sh is the build script.  
xap.rb is the Ruby companion to the build script.  Together, they leave
behind several build artifacts:

*  pearson.txt       a raw list of wordnames for the pearson.rb script
*  pettil-core.def   assembler include file to convey core labels to transient
*  pettil-core.err   core build log, generated by xa65
*  pettil-core.lab   core label file, generated by xa65
*  pettil-core.obj   core object file, generated by xa65
*  pettil.json       tiddlers extracted from the source code
*  pettil.mon        VICE xpet monitor labels for debugging
*  pettil.obj    <-- The loadable, runnable binary for the PET
*  pettil.sym        wordnames and code field addresses
*  pettil-tdict.err  transient dictionary build log, generated by xa65
*  pettil-tdict.lab  transient dictionary label file, generated by xa65
*  pettil-tdict.obj  transient dictionary binary
*  tiddlypettil/output/tiddlypettil.html     autogenerated documentation

There is no linker or relocation loader.  pettil.obj is a simple concatenation
of pettil-core.obj + pettil-tdict.obj + pettil.sym

To build PETTIL, clone this repository, install xa65, ruby and VICE

$ source xap.sh         # this does a build and runs PETTIL

sourcing xap.sh sets up two symbols, 'xap' and 'pettil'
$ xap                   # build pettil
$ pettil                # run pettil
