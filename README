PETTIL is being developed with the vice package xpet emulator under Linux and Windows

pettil.a65 is the main source for Forth
sweet16.a65 is the source for Sweet16 and extensions

editor.a65 is the screen editor

the compilation steps are as follows:

$ xa -x pettil.a65

this generates a label file that pettil.sh parses (the sed command)

$ ./pettil.sh

parses the label file into something the vice monitor will like
automatic breakpoints can optionally be added to pettil.sh to invoke the VICE xpet monitor

I use Geany.  The build commands I use are:
F8  Assemble   xa -x %e.a65;./%e.sh
F5  Execute    pwd;ls %e.*;echo xpet -moncommand %e.lab %e.obj;xpet -moncommand %e.lab %e.obj



Objectives of the project are, in no particular order:
* make a Forth that runs on my Commodore PET 2001
* have fun
* execution speed features
* * direct-threaded model with a 15-cycle "next"
* * split data stack on zero page
* * TOS in a separate zero page word
* * lots of primitives coded in assembler
* * hash-threaded dictionary
* improve my "6502 assembly golf" skills
* meet other people who are interested in this project

Future direction
* have a "Forth written in Forth" (metacompilation)
* separate spaces for code and dictionary headers
* file-based and block-based source code storage
