PETTIL is being developed with the vice package xpet emulator under Linux and Windows

The project blog is at http://pettil.tumblr.com
More in the Forth and Programming forums at http://forum.6502.org

pettil.a65 is the main source for Forth
the rest of the code is in the modules/ directory

To build PETTIL, clone this repository, install xa65, ruby and VICE

$ source xap.sh         # this does a build and runs PETTIL 

sourcing it sets up two symbols, 'xap' and 'pettil'
$ xap					# build pettil
$ pettil				# run pettil


Objectives of the project are, in no particular order:
* make a Forth that runs on my Commodore PET 2001
* have fun
* execution speed features
* * direct-threaded model with a 15-cycle "next"
* * split data stack on zero page
* * TOS in a separate zero page word
* * lots of primitives coded in assembler
* * hash-threaded dictionary
* improve my "6502 assembly golf" skills
* find other people who are interested in this project

Future direction
* have a "Forth written in Forth" (metacompilation)
* separate spaces for code and dictionary headers
* file-based and block-based source code storage
