PETTIL is being developed with the Ubuntu xa65 and vice packages (under Linux Mint 9).

Objectives of the project are, in no particular order:
* make a Forth that runs on my Commodore PET 2001
* have fun
* execution speed features
* * direct-threaded model with a 17-cycle "next"
* * split data stack on zero page
* * TOS in a separate zero page word
* * lots of primitives coded in assembler
* * hash-threaded dictionary
* improve my "6502 assembly golf" skills
* meet other people who are interested in this project

Future direction
* have a "Forth written in Forth" (metacompilation)
* separate spaces for code and dictionary headers
* file-based and block-based source code storage
