PETTIL is being developed with the vice package, which is a Commodore PET
emulator that runs under several different operating systems.  I'm doing 
this on Ubuntu Linux, but Windows and Mac users should be able to use
PETTIL too.  Eventually a C=64 port is planned.

The project blog is at http://pettil.tumblr.com

The documentation in Tiddlywiki format is generated from the source code
tree.  In addition to a Glossary, I will try to describe some of the more
unusual concepts for an 8-bit Forth and attempt to justify why I put them
into PETTIL.  A copy from the most recent build is hosted at 
http://chitselb.com/files/tiddlypettil.html  Please email chitselb@gmail.com
with any suggestions for improving the documentation.  I want my mom to be
able to understand this and run PETTIL.

More in the Forth and Programming forums at http://forum.6502.org

pettil.a65 is the main source for Forth
the rest of the code is in the modules/ directory

To build PETTIL, clone this repository, install xa65, ruby and VICE

$ source xap.sh         # this does a build and runs PETTIL

sourcing it sets up two symbols, 'xap' and 'pettil'
$ xap                   # build pettil
$ pettil                # run pettil


Objectives of the project are, in no particular order:
* make a Forth that runs on my Commodore PET 2001
* have fun
* improve my "6502 assembly golf" skills
* find other people who are interested in this project

Future directions
* have a "Forth written in Forth" (metacompilation)
* separate spaces for code and dictionary headers
* implement a retro videogame 
* add support for more 6502-based computers and storage devices
