; The ENTER primitive doesn't bother to check if the CFA following
; JSR ENTER spans a page boundary.  The compiler takes care of this 
; with CFA, and the assembler handles it here with:
;
; #include "align.i65"
;
; If a primitive uses JSR to determine its address, page-aligning 
; is only required to work around the 6502 JMP (indirect) bug.
