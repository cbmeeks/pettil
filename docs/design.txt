EDITOR

Forth blocks and the PET full screen editor are a natural symbiosis.
To accomplish this, all I had to do was hook the IRQ vector to escape 
the STOP key.  The screen flashes, and the following keystroke is an
editor command.  Entire screens, including the linewrap table, are 
compressed and then moved, where they build downward from  the top of
memory.  This region is preserved on mass storage in sequential files.  
There are also editor commands to import/export screens in an unpacked,
CR-delimited format for non-native editing.

screens to/from CR-delimited only? 
	no line wrap tables
	simplifies UI design to just STOP-S / STOP-L
	probably easier for INTERPRET loop
	uses CHRIN kernel routine to copy screen
what about reverse-field, just a screen full of graphics?  Should there
be an option to store screens as RLE-compressed screen codes and a copy
of the line-wrap table?  What about 1K blocks of binary data?

edit - invoke the editor on the most recent screen

Editor commands begin with STOP, which flashes the screen
STOP SPACE - cancel editor command
STOP STOP - save current screen, exit the editor
STOP UP - previous screen
STOP DOWN - next screen
STOP HOME - first screen
STOP CLR - reset linewrap table to all 40-char lines
STOP S - save screens to file
STOP L - load a file of screens
STOP E - export uncompressed screens to a file
STOP I - import a file of uncompressed screens
STOP DEL - delete the current screen.  Replace with next then prev then blank
STOP INS - insert a blank screen before the current screen


Screens are compressed/decompressed on the fly with some combination
of RLE/LZ/Rad50



Events / Multitasking

Have some sort of event queue, where high level words are triggered
by the jiffy clock IRQ.  See Garth's design

The IRQ counts down a timer, with events triggered at their expiration

oneshot   ( jiffies cfa -- ; add a one-time event to the queue )
repeat   ( jiffies cfa -- ; add a repeating event to the queue )

use the event queue to flash the screen in the editor for 5 jiffies
