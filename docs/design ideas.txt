Events / Multitasking

Have some sort of event queue, where high level words are triggered
by the jiffy clock IRQ.  See Garth's design

The IRQ counts down a timer, with events triggered at their expiration

oneshot   ( jiffies cfa -- ; add a one-time event to the queue )
repeat   ( jiffies cfa -- ; add a repeating event to the queue )

use the event queue to flash the screen in the editor for 5 jiffies
